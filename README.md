# NYCU 2022 Spring AI Final Project
## Tetris Environment
Tetris environment is from [source](https://github.com/michiel-cox/Tetris-DQN.git)

### Action for human testing

| Keyboard  | Move |
| ---: | ---: |
| Right | shift right 1 block |
| Left | shift left 1 block |
| Space | drop down |
| Shift | hold |
| r | restart the game |


### How to run
Run `run_human.py` to play Tetris manually.

## Goal
Write our own tetris AI agent using DQN algorithm.
It we still got time, we want to modify the agent so it have performance similar to human (maybe also try out other algorithms). Then, write a new `view.py` to play manually on the left and run AI on the right side, so we can battle against the AI we wrote.
